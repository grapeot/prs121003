 We'll get one hour to present the following two papers:
 
 * Alexander Toshev, Jianbo Shi, and Kostas Daniilidis, "Image Matching via Saliency Region Correspondences, " IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2007
 * R. Tron and R. Vidal, "Distributed Computer Vision Algorithms Through Distributed Averaging," In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2011.

 We'll also spend several minutes on an interesting paper:
  * Simon Korman, Shai Avidan, "Coherency Sensitive Hashing," ICCV 2011, Barcelona
